* problems to fix
** worker
*** sending updates for points that are not in the skyline
** master
*** what is window time and what are we doing with it?
*** oddity-> don't update entries if they are replaced with a newer entry of the same value
*** points don't get expired
*** when a former skyline point is removed, it gets added right back
*** fix the counter so that when a worker drops out, we don't include their contribution to the current skyline
*** ensure that each worker can only contribute once to the skyline
*** worker's data will not expire if the worker is gone
* implementation
** how can we check on both time and step-> could include both in the tuple
* cases to test
** single worker add/remove
** multi-worker add/remove
*** setup-> 2 workers, window of 2
*** step 0-> each worker sends 2 skylines, but only 1 will be kept
*** step 1-> worker 1 overtakes worker 2 skyline
*** step 2-> worker 1 replace old entry
** expiring points on worker
** attempt streaming
